Call this tool AS SOON AS the first user message conveys the user's intent — i.e. immediately after reading the initial ask, before doing any substantive work. The session name should be short, kebab-case, and summarize the task, ticket number (if any), repository, and feature name. Renaming early keeps the session identifiable in the session list and in version-control metadata while work is ongoing.

The agent's own name (e.g. \`keen-gar-77\`) is always kept as the prefix of the session name, separated by \`: \`. Provide the descriptive part only (e.g. \`fix-auth-bug\`); the tool composes the full name as \`<agent-name>: <description>\`. If the provided name already starts with the agent-name prefix it is not double-prefixed.`;

/**
 * Compose a session name that keeps the agent name as a prefix.

 * - `keen-gar-77` + `"fix auth bug"` → `keen-gar-77: fix auth bug`
 * - `keen-gar-77` + `"keen-gar-77: fix auth bug"` → `keen-gar-77: fix auth bug` (idempotent)
 * - `keen-gar-77` + `""` → `keen-gar-77` (no description, keep the bare name)
 * - `""` + `"fix auth bug"` → `fix auth bug` (no agent name yet, no `: ` prefix)
 *
 * The provided name is trimmed. When the trimmed value already starts with
 * `<agentName>: ` the prefix is not repeated.
